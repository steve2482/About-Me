      <h1>Introduction:</h1>
      <p>I am a laid back person who doesn't let things get me too worked up. I enjoy working in teams and helping teach or train people. I am somewhat soft spoken but have no problem speaking out if I can contribute to a discussion or help in any way.</p>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in <a href="thinkful.com">Thinkful's</a> Web Developer Career Path program with the goal to graduate and obtain a job within the field of software development.</p>
      <p>I am proud to say I am 31 years of age, married with a daughter on the way, and have two rescue labradors.</p>
